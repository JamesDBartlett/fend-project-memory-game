## Instructions

This is a game that tests the short term memory of the player. Click on a card to reveal its symbol. Click another card to see if it matches the first. If you get a match, the two cards you've selected will remain visible. If you don't get a match, the cards will flip back, and you'll have to try and remember where you saw those symbols. Keep clicking and matching until all of the cards are displayed, and you will win the game!
